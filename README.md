# Final_Project_Data_Structures

Emergency rooms have a difficult time keeping track of how many rooms are available and when a new room will come available for new patients. 
A program to keep track of when rooms are available to a list of patients, and which patients need to be cared for first can help nurses and doctors 
with streamlining the process and get care for patients faster.

The solution will use a priority queue to keep track of patients which will bring patients in need of the most urgent care at the front of the queue 
first. The rooms will be tracked with a linked list that will update over time with a timer of how soon a room will be open for the next patient in the 
priority queue.
